Specifics about my room (how the lights work, how to use my projector, etc) can be found <a href="other.html">here</a>.

                                        <p> Each day cora gets:</p>
                                        <b>2 scoops of dry food</b>
                                            <li> Coraâ€™s food container is on the bottom of the bookshelf with the plant. If the container runs out, there is a new bag on top of the refridgerator. She gets two scoops per day (scooper is inside the food bin). I usually feed her before bed, but anytime is fine. If there is any remaining food in the bowl and it's been a full day since her last feeding, I usually pour it back into the food bin and mix it around a bit before putting a scoops in her bowl. If it's been less than a full day, just pour the new food on top of the old food. </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <b>1 probiotic packet</b>
                                            <li> Cora's probiotic is called Fortiflora, amd the packets are on top of the refridgerator. Using the red polka-dot bowl (or another small bowl), dissolve the probiotic in a little bit of water and then add the wet food.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <b>wet food (~1/4 small can or ~1/8 big can)</b>
                                            <li> Wet food is in cans on top of the refridgerator.
                                            <li> Add the wet food to the probiotic/water mixture and mix it up. Add however much more water as you think you can to the mixture without making it too runny/soupy.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <p> Cora's <b>water</b> is in the bowl on the shelf between the living room and kitchen. It gets dust and/or hair in it, so I typically replace the water every 1-2 days. <!---There is also a gravity water bowl on the floor just in case.---> </p>
                                        <p> Unfortunately Cora's body is very sensitive and she is not allowed treats. :-( I have only recently started her on the probiotic to help with digesting the wet food. If she seems to be doing well with the wet food, you're more than welcome to give her some more as a little treat. </p>
