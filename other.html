The button next to the "E" allows shows you the input source selections, up and down arrows on the bottom let you toggle through choices, and the button next to "M" selects your choice. Also, the up/down arrows control volume.
                                            <li>There are HDMI cables in one of the desk drawers.  </li>
                                            <li>There is an Amazon Fire Stick plugged into one of the HDMI spots, and the remote control is on the desk. Just push some of the buttons on the firestick remote to wake it up when you're turning the monitor on, and it should pop up. </li>
                                            <li>The remote does not control the volume, but I have bluetooth speakers that work with the remote! They are blue and are above the shelf with the plant. Turn one of them on and it should connect (They are called Wonderboom 1 and Wonderboom 2 if you need to mannually connect them).</li>
                                            <li>Sometimes the monitor can be a little tempermental. Call me if you have any issues and I'll try to walk you through getting it set up!</li>
