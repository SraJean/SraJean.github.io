                                            <li> You can also change the color of the lights. (ex. "Echo, make the light by the chair red.", "Echo, make the light by the chair white.")</li>
                                            <li> If you would prefer to use the light switch, just turn on the lights by the closet and mirror using the wake-word and then leave them on and just control it with the switch. </li>
                                            <li> If you have any problems with the lights and are unable to turn them on, let me know and I will turn them on using my phone and you can then use the switch.</li>

                                            <li>I have a projector with an Amazon Fire TV Stick for watching shows and movies in my room. I left it set up in the closet; feel free to move it wherever you want.</li>
                                            <li> I usually have it in one of two places:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li> If watching from bed: I take down the top picture frame on the wall above the litter box and point it there.</li>
                                                    <li> If watching from the chair: I have a white curtain to pull in front of the closet door, and I set up the projector on the opposite side of the bed.</li>
                                                </ul>

                                                    <li> The remote with the red power button <img src="images/projector.jpeg" alt="Projector Remote"width="100"> controls the projector power and volume, but needs to be pointed at the projector from a certain angles so might take a few tries. There is also a power button on the top of the projector that I usually use when turning it on.</li>
                                                    <li>The other remote <img src="images/fire.jpg" alt="Fire TV Stick Remote"width="100"> controls the Fire TV Stick apps. You will need to press any button on this remote once the projector is on to see the home screen. This remote can be used at any angle (it isn’t sensitive like the other remote). </li>

                                            <li>There is a lens cap on the projector that you will need to remove, and the picture will need to be focused using the slidy thing above the lens.</li>
